# Space-Invaders

The folder labled Space Invaders contains the .py file and all images and sounds involved in space invaders. You can move your ship side to side with the right and left arrow keys. Spacebar fires your missle.

All you need to know about pong is that you use the up and down arrows to move the right paddle and the w and s keys (w for up, s for down) to move the left paddle.
